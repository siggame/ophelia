# Ophelia - The SIG-Game Webserver

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This is the repository for SIG-Game's webserver application, the main entry point
for competitors of MegaMinerAI.

## Getting Started - Developers

To develop on the project, you'll need a newer version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS is preferred) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

If you're on Windows, [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is reccomended as a replacement for Command Prompt.

Once you've installed that and cloned the project files down, go ahead and run the following:
```
$ yarn run setup
```

This will install all of the needed packages and put you back in the base directory of the repo. Once you're there, run the following to start the server in debug mode:
```
yarn run debug
```
You can then navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to use the site.

Once you make changes to the files on your local machine, refresh the page in your browser
to see your changes.
